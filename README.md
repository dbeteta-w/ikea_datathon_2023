# ikea_datathon_2023

The present repository shows our winner proposal for the Datathon 
organized by IKEA, which consisted of two main challenges:

### 1. Waste Challenge

Understanding, predicting and reducing food waste by IKEA's restaurants, 
in line with the Swedish company's commitment to sustainability, 
cost consciousness and leading by example.

**Winner idea:** Transform the amount of wasted food by category to the amount
of money wasted by each category, in order to create a dashboard 
aligned with the mentioned objectives.

### 2. Visit Challenge 

Forecasting the amount of visits per day of the month of March 2023 in the
Barcelona and Madrid stores, as a manner to optimize the resources needed in 
terms of inventory, employees and even to improve the Marketing strategies.

**Winner idea:** Substitute the empty values of the dataset with the average of 
its correspondent day of the week (as the stationality is weekly) and 
optimize the hyperparameters of an autoregresor 
based on the Gradient Boosting algorithm.
